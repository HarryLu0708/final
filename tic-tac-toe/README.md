# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with PvP mode and PvE mode
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkuDxrOqRQk
#### Description:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a serial game played on 3*3 grids, similar to gobang. It is named because the chessboard generally does not draw borders and the grid lines are arranged in well characters. The tools required for the game are only paper and pen, and then two players representing O and X take turns to leave marks in the grid (generally X first). Any three markers form a straight line to win.

In this program, I reproduce the game of Tic Tac Toe. I've done a qualifying console program in Java. The program has two modes, one is PVE mode. Players can fight against the artificial intelligence in the game. At the same time, the player can also choose another mode. PVP mode, in this mode players can play this game with their friends or family.

In this program, I mainly use a two-dimensional array to record the player's game. Players can play the game by entering coordinates. Because this is the type of control operation common to console games, use the keyboard instead of the mouse to play. At the same time I also used the loop to complete the algorithm of printing the board in the game and checking the victory.
